This test runs the Berlin SPARQL BenchMark (BSBM) on an Apache Jena triple store. This benchmark is available
[here](http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/berlinsparqlbenchmark/).

The other applications needed are: Apache Jena and Apache Jena Fuseki that can be
downloaded from the [Apache Jena download directory](https://jena.apache.org/download/).

Obviously all the paths inside `submit-common.sh` should be adjusted.
